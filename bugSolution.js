The solution involves correctly configuring the `SafeAreaProvider` component from `react-native-safe-area-context`. Ensure that it encompasses all the components that should be within the safe area. Also verify compatibility of all installed libraries and versions of React Native.  Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <View style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
      }}>
        <Text>This text is now correctly positioned within the safe area.</Text>
      </View>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
